# Simply-Supported-Beam-Analysis


# Beam Analysis Web Application

This is a user-friendly web application designed to help you analyze beams by visualizing their **shear force** and **bending moment** diagrams.

---

## Features

* **Interactive Input:** Easily input key parameters such as:
    * **Load Magnitude:** The force applied to the beam.
    * **Beam Length:** The total length of the beam.
    * **Load Position:** The exact point where the load is applied along the beam.
* **Automated Diagram Generation:** Based on your input, the application automatically generates:
    * **Shear Force Diagram (SFD):** A graphical representation of the shear force along the beam's length.
    * **Bending Moment Diagram (BMD):** A graphical representation of the bending moment along the beam's length.
* **Point-Specific Analysis:** Determine the precise **shear force** and **bending moment** at any chosen point along the beam.

1.  **Enter Load Magnitude:** Input the force applied to the beam in the designated field.
2.  **Enter Beam Length:** Specify the total length of the beam.
3.  **Enter Load Position:** Indicate where the load is applied along the beam's length.
4.  **View Diagrams:** The application will automatically generate and display the Shear Force Diagram and Bending Moment Diagram based on your inputs.
5.  **Analyze at a Point:** Use the specific input field to find the shear force and bending moment at any desired point along the beam.
